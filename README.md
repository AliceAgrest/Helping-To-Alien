# Helping-To-Alien
***One of the projects from the Network course(From Magshimim)*** <br>
In this project in givin app I need to find two password and help to the alien to get him home<br><br>
The main idea was to do sniff and see what the server gives, but it's not that easy like it seems<br>
The data was encrypted and every packet had there own key for decryption<br>
When I decrypted the messages i saw that the first password was the name pne of planets (Jupiter)<br>
After that the app opens timer for the minute to write another password, with this server sedes all lot of data that also decrypted<br>
And my mission was to collect location and fix fly message <br>
After all that the alien was sented to Jupiter<br>
